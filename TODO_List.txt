Add Spouse name to other spouses platform near the connecting bridge
Add a Generic tombstone at the end of peoples platforms that have died - extra credit - figure out how to tag a photo in rootsmagic to be identified as the actual tombstone picture for your ancester.

Show relationship between "root person" and current visited platform.


Allow name picker filter text to have the pattern "last, first"  so the filtering extends into the first name, example "Kennedy, J"

Fix up bogus (or zero) birthdate base on parents birth
Add female player, Pearl, from Mixamo
(Spike) Try a WebGL version to see how reading the database from AWS (Dynamo or mysql in S3) might works
Need to get CoRoutines working so that Loading Spinner will work.
   Make DBLoad Person List / MyTribe Data read be yeildable so that something like a spinner or other animation can play while it loads.
   Spinner on Start button to help give the user an idea that a long process is happily churning away.
Add cool Sound effects
Particle effects at teleporters

Random Ideas:
Could we do a virtual terminal into a RootsMagic session from the game??
This would allow data updates, fixes, or addtions to occur while just taking a 'pause' from the play action.


*** Future Story ------ Inferred Dates Range ----			
Ask person object for Inferred Birthdate range		(Future Story)
	an Inferred date range (evidences from family connections)
	Rough date start, Rough date end
	or Null, not available

*** Future Story ------ Validate Dates ----				
Future Story: Ask person to evaluate Birth Date Evidences - colors are 'evidence quality colors' perhaps checkmarks - only shown when asked for
	Green Check - all dates match
	Yellow Check - some data point in dissagreement
	Red Check - Data/Evidences disagree
