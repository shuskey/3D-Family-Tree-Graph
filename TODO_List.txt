X History Panel: Make each panel interactible, once the panel has 'focus' Left (previous event) Right 
X Come up with Gamecontroller buttons for menu (back / left small black button) -> restart (start / right small black button) & set new root person
X History Panel should get <<  >> markings to tell user that Previous and Next buttons will act on this object.
X Separate Canvas Panel for Event Details
X Make Event Details Panel vanish when not "in view"
X Improve performace of loading history panels, perhaps being able to re-use panels already loaded - Used a Dictionary
X THis came for free: Last chosen viewed event for that year maintains when jumping to another person

History Panel: Make each panel interactible (E key or north button) visit to Wikipage
Improve the performance of this 'reset' root person operation

Add Spouse name to other spouses platform near the connecting bridge
Add a Generic tombstone at the end of peoples platforms that have died - extra credit - figure out how to tag a photo in rootsmagic to be identified as the actual tombstone picture for your ancester.
Show relationship between "root person" and current visited platform.
Allow name picker filter text to have the pattern "last, first"  so the filtering extends into the first name, example "Kennedy, J"
Fix scrolling of the "Choose a person" scrolling drop down.
> Brick Walls displayed at dead ends

>In Progress  "Hall of History"
Perhaps get History Panels to be sensitive to region (location) with major region events focused on persons locations
Perhaps the ability to select which categories to include, perhaps categories are
    Major Wars (done), USA events, European events, Religious events, political, economic etc

>> Future
Have options for displaying Fashion, Art Styles, Architecture, Science/Inventions, Sports, Famous people (intertainment/politics/culture/sports)

More Photos
Can photo's be synced from FamilySearch to RootsMagic?

>>Photo Gaminization: Gamify Organization - Use local or cloud repository of photos and Resource Description Framework (RDF) concept to link photos to their correct context
Premise: I have a lot of photos with just a little bit of built in context
If I put my photo's into a Frozen Read only state, I can begin with some simple Semantic (RDF) links, including:
  Branch of Family that the photo's are from
  Date Range
  File Names (or other tagged into in the file)
  Perhaps location or rough location.
Now imagine a Hall of History type of display along a persons timeline (perhaps left side), where photos that at least rougly match that person are displayed.
One key: random distribution within the known context.
 - Randomly distribute photos along the persons timeline. The more context that a photo has, the more restrictive its placement will be, for example:
 A photo with no Context at all could randomly be place anywhere (any time slot) on any persons timeline.
 A photo with some context will be restricted to that context, for example photos beloging to a family branch.  Or taken in a specific year. Or photos of that specific person.
 The hope is that this will 'gamify' itself, as a user plays though their family history, they will see a picture that does not belong, and they will add more context to the picture.
 - Perhaps each photo would need a context meter (green through red)  Green indicating that the photo has enough context to deserve to be placed on a specific persons timeline at that specific time.
 and red meaning - this is a random photo placement
 So the context(s) that the user might add are:
 - this photo is too old/new for this placement (move it back or forward in time)
 - this photo is not for this family branch - perhaps its a cousin's
 - this photo does not contain this person or this person's family
 - this is not a family history photo (random photo that does not belong)
 - The user may recognize people in the photo, and go ahead and tag them.
 - The user may recognize the date or location of the photo and go ahead and tag that.


Optionally - Show LDS ordenances
Fix up bogus (or zero) birthdate base on parents birth
Add female player, Pearl, from Mixamo
(Spike) Try a WebGL version to see how reading the database from AWS (Dynamo or mysql in S3) might works
(Spike) Try a Mac version - need access to a Mac
Need to get CoRoutines working so that Loading Spinner will work.
   Make DBLoad Person List / MyTribe Data read be yeildable so that something like a spinner or other animation can play while it loads.
   Spinner on Start button to help give the user an idea that a long process is happily churning away.
Add cool Sound effects
Particle effects at teleporters

*** Future Stories ***
**********************
RootsMagic Launch to Person Page - Is it possible?
Add a button or something that lets me go get more family information while standing on a paltform - like go get me Alex's parents.  Note that the reset root person functionality kind or replaces the need for this.

Random Ideas:
Could we do a virtual terminal into a RootsMagic session from the game??
This would allow data updates, fixes, or addtions to occur while just taking a 'pause' from the play action.


*** Future Story ------ Inferred Dates Range ----			
Ask person object for Inferred Birthdate range		(Future Story)
	an Inferred date range (evidences from family connections)
	Rough date start, Rough date end
	or Null, not available

*** Future Story ------ Validate Dates ----				
Future Story: Ask person to evaluate Birth Date Evidences - colors are 'evidence quality colors' perhaps checkmarks - only shown when asked for
	Green Check - all dates match
	Yellow Check - some data point in dissagreement
	Red Check - Data/Evidences disagree
