*** Future Story ------ Validate Dates ----				
Future Story: Ask person to evaluate Birth Date Evidences - colors are 'evidence quality colors' perhaps checkmarks - only shown when asked for
	Green Check - all dates match
	Yellow Check - some data point in dissagreement
	Red Check - Data/Evidences disagree
