3D Family Tree Graph TODOs:
X Get spring physics right
X Drag and or friction - yes add drag to Node Prefab
X Bring in "Adam and Eve" family generator
 	
Specialize Edges - different spring attractions:
 - Marrage Edges (tightest coupling)
 - OffSpring Edges
	Future: Divorced, Adopted

- Story - Create EventDate DataType - that takes into account rough or unknown dates
EventDate associated with a person
	Event Type: Birth, Adopted, Marriage, Divorced, Death
	nullable Specific Date
	Rough date
		Year
		Month
	Non understood Date String or string clue, no year indicated "23" "Feb 23", or non handled "300bc"
	Qualifier "About", means the same as: Estimate, Calculated, Circa, Say, certainly, probably, possibly, likely, perhaps, maybe)
	Unknown (absolutly no information)
	Range (future story)
	Inferred (future story)
	
	Ask person object for Birth Date - Also available for Marriage Date, or Death Date (inferred dates will be latest, not eariest)
	Returns either a - colors are 'date quality colors' - perhaps a shell around date bubbles
		Specific Date (green), or
		Specific Date with Qualifier string, Calculated or Rough Earliest Date (yellow), or
		Inferred earliest Date (orange), or (future story)
		null - not availabe (black) (inferred also returns null)  - Use todays date
	
---- Future Story ----- Date Range
Another type of date, is a date range, this would include two EventDates as defined above: (Start, End) examples
(Unknown, specific Date) "before"
(specific Date, unknown) "after"
(Rough Date, Rough Date) "Range"
(Specific, Specific) "range" or an "OR"

---- Future Story ------ Inferred Dates ----
The caluculated date, or date range can be used when a specific date is unknown,
or can be used as a validation of a specific date that is also given
Calculated Date from Age in Records list (when a date is unkown)
	Age Years
	Age Month (nullable)
	Age Days (nullable)
	Date of record (specific date)
	Name of Record
			
---- Future Story ------ Inferred Dates Range ----			
Ask person object for Inferred Birthdate range		(Future Story)
	an Inferred date range (evidences from family connections)
	Rough date start, Rough date end
	or Null, not available

---- Future Story ------ Validate Dates ----				
Future Story: Ask person to evaluate Birth Date Evidences - colors are 'evidence quality colors' perhaps checkmarks - only shown when asked for
	Green Check - all dates match
	Yellow Check - some data point in dissagreement
	Red Check - Data/Evidences disagree
