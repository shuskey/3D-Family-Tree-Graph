Random Ideas:
Could we do a virtual terminal into a RootsMagic session from the game??
This would allow data updates, fixes, or addtions to occur while just taking a 'pause' from the play action.


*** Future Story ------ Inferred Dates Range ----			
Ask person object for Inferred Birthdate range		(Future Story)
	an Inferred date range (evidences from family connections)
	Rough date start, Rough date end
	or Null, not available

*** Future Story ------ Validate Dates ----				
Future Story: Ask person to evaluate Birth Date Evidences - colors are 'evidence quality colors' perhaps checkmarks - only shown when asked for
	Green Check - all dates match
	Yellow Check - some data point in dissagreement
	Red Check - Data/Evidences disagree
