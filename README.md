# 3D-Family-Tree-Graph
The vision of this project is to provide and emersive 3D experience for exploring your Family History.
This project should be the foundation for:
 - A fun interactive playground for exploration, discovery, challenges, and learning (Think Quests and Side Quests)
 - A Visual Family History Diagnostic tool for detecting, and correcting problems in your Family History Data. This diagnostic tool may also give renewed research insights for finding and updating missing or incorrect information.
